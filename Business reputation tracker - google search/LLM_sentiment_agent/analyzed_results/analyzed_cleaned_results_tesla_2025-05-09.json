    "content": "Tesla’s Fight for Survival: Why Americans Are Abandoning the Brand\n\nTesla, once the darling of electric vehicles, is facing significant challenges in the U.S. due to Elon Musk's political affiliations and actions. The company has been targeted with vandalism, protests, and even firebombings, prompting FBI investigations. Despite producing some of the most competitive EVs, Tesla's stock has fallen over 34% year-to-date, with profits plummeting 71% in Q1 2025.\n\nThe backlash largely stems from Musk's involvement with the government, including the creation of DOGE and the Department of Government Efficiency, which has led to thousands of public sector job cuts. These controversies have fueled distrust and hostility toward Tesla among many Americans.\n\nWhile Tesla remains a symbol of American innovation—boasting large manufacturing plants and outselling competitors like Honda and Toyota in 2024—public sentiment is shifting. Vandalism and protests have been categorized as domestic terrorism, with the FBI establishing a task force to address anti-Tesla attacks.\n\nDespite these issues, Tesla continues to be a major player in the EV market, with a 550% stock increase over five years and widespread charging infrastructure. However, consumer distrust and negative perceptions of Musk threaten its future in the U.S. market. The company’s success will depend on addressing these sentiment issues and strategic leadership decisions.",

In 2020, over 10 million electric cars were on the road worldwide, a 43% increase from 2019, with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) accounting for two-thirds of new registrations and stock. China leads with 4.5 million electric cars, while Europe saw the largest annual increase, reaching 3.2 million.\n\nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic causing a global decline in overall car sales, electric vehicle (EV) registrations increased, with Europe more than doubling registrations to 1.4 million, driven by policy measures and subsidies. China’s EV market grew to 5.7% of new car sales, while the US saw a modest increase to 2%. Consumer spending on EVs reached USD 120 billion, a 50% rise from 2019, with government incentives totaling USD 14 billion.\n\nThe availability of EV models expanded to 370 globally, with SUVs comprising over 55% of new models. The average range of new BEVs increased to 350 km in 2020. Electric light commercial vehicles (LCVs) and heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) also saw growth, with electric buses and trucks expanding in China, Europe, and North America.\n\nPrivate sector commitments include Amazon’s order of 100,000 BEV light-commercial vehicles and numerous companies aiming for net-zero emissions by 2040–2050. Battery production capacity increased, with China dominating over 70% of global capacity, and Europe and the US expanding their manufacturing.\n\nCharging infrastructure grew to 1.3 million publicly accessible chargers, with China leading in both slow and fast chargers. Planning for long-distance heavy-duty trucking is underway, with megacharger standards being developed to support high-capacity charging for freight trucks.\n\nOverall, OEMs are increasingly committing to electrification, with many planning to produce only electric vehicles by 2030–2035. The market for electric heavy-duty vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) is also expanding, supported by government policies and infrastructure investments.",

The company delivered a record 1.8 million vehicles in 2023, generating over $78.5 billion in revenue, primarily from automotive sales. Tesla's net income has grown significantly since 2020, despite rising costs, and the company continues investing in AI and connected vehicle technologies.\n\nTesla's U.S. market remains its most important, with a substantial market share and an expanding Supercharger network, now open to more electric vehicles. However, increasing competition from Chinese automakers like BYD, which overtook Tesla as the best-selling EV brand in 2022, poses challenges. Startups such as Rivian and Lucid face profitability issues, with Lucid reporting a net loss of approximately $2.8 billion in 2023.\n\nProduction and delivery figures show Tesla produced around 495,600 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2024 and delivered similar numbers. The company's global revenue reached approximately $97.7 billion in 2024, with a quarterly operating margin of 6.2%. Tesla's market capitalization remains substantial, and its R&D expenses in 2024 totaled around $4.5 billion.\n\nTesla continues expanding its energy generation and storage segment, with revenues around $10 billion. The company is also actively involved in environmental initiatives, including battery recycling and reducing manufacturing emissions.

    "content": "Tesla: The True Untold Story\n\nTesla, Inc. (TSLA) is often associated with Elon Musk, whose leadership and controversies keep the company in the spotlight. Founded in 2003 by engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, Tesla aimed to produce high-performance electric vehicles (EVs). Musk, an early investor and board member, became CEO in 2008 after internal conflicts led to Eberhard and Tarpenning's departure.\n\n**Founding and Early Development**  \nEberhard and Tarpenning, both technology entrepreneurs with backgrounds in electrical engineering and computer science, founded Tesla to create a mainstream electric sports car, inspired by Nikola Tesla. They licensed technology from AC Propulsion and collaborated with Lotus to modify the Elise chassis, developing the Roadster, which offered over 245 miles per charge and sports car performance.\n\n**Funding and Leadership Changes**  \nInitially self-funded, Tesla raised $7.5 million in 2004, with Musk investing $6.5 million. As Tesla grew, internal tensions arose. Musk, seeking greater control, pushed out Eberhard in 2007 and Tarpenning in 2008. The company’s first manufacturing plant was established in Fremont, California.\n\n**Legal and Legacy**  \nIn 2009, Eberhard sued Tesla and Musk for breach of contract; the case was settled out of court. Tesla recognizes five founders: Wright, Eberhard, Tarpenning, Straubel, and Musk. Eberhard and Tarpenning contributed significantly to Tesla’s technological innovations, including lithium-ion batteries and the initial business plan.\n\n**Tesla Today**  \nDespite producing fewer vehicles than traditional automakers, Tesla’s market capitalization exceeds that of major American automakers, driven by its role as a technology company with growth in renewable energy, software, and AI. Tesla's vertical integration and innovation continue to give it competitive advantages.\n\n**Summary**  \nTesla’s story is more nuanced than the popular \"Great Man\" narrative. While Musk’s leadership transformed Tesla into an industry giant, its origins, vision, and core technologies are rooted in the efforts of its original founders. Understanding this history offers insights into technological change, startup dynamics, and industry evolution.",
