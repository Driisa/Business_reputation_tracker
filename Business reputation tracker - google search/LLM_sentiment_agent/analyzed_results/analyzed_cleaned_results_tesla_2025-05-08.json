They're all being used against Tesla because of its CEO's affiliation to the ministration.Charles Singh USA TODAY NETWORKShow Caption Hide Caption ‘Tallahassee Tesla Takedown’ protestNearly 50 people gathered to protest Elon Musk and his business. The crowd chanted \"Musk to Mars.\"American car brand Tesla is feeling the heat in reaction to Elon Musk's recent political moves.Teslas have been firebombed and vandalized, prompting an F.B.I. investigation.The company faces an existential threat despite producing some of the most competitive EVs on the market.We live in a world where current events have truly become stranger than fiction at times. Tesla, once the electric vehicle darling, is now public enemy No. 1 in the eyes of millions of American car buyers.Is this due to a severe mechanical malfunction or product issue? No, Tesla's recent fall from grace is under no uncertain terms the result of its eccentric CEO's affiliation with the President of the United States. Elon Musk is no stranger to controversy, but tensions have reached an all-time high with the creation of DOGE.The Department of Government Efficiency, Musk's brainchild, has been responsible for thousands of job cuts in the public sector. Whether or not you agree with these cuts or DOGE's methods, it's impossible to ignore Tesla's recent stock market nose dive. Tesla (TSLA) stock is down at least 34% year-to-date after an incredible start to the first quarter. The share price dipped below $222 as of April 8, 2025. Tesla stock reached record highs in late 2024, so how on Earth did we get here, and why does everyone suddenly hate Tesla?Tesla's Q1 revenue crashes: Profits plummet 71% amid backlash to Musk's role with Trump ministrationAmerica's love-hate relationship with TeslaIt may be easy to dismiss Tesla as a brand because of its CEO's antics, strong anti-union sentiments, and lack of transparency with the press. Not to mention consistent promises during shareholder meetings and rollouts that often seem like dreams rather than achievable goals. Musk shoots for the moon, regardless of how hard the landing may be.America's relationship with Tesla is an odd one because on one end of the spectrum, the company is a true testament to the ingenuity of American engineering. After all, Teslas are easily some of the most American-me vehicles in the country. The company created huge plants in America employing thousands and pushing the envelope for the team in the EV space.Rivals like Rivian show plenty of promise, but no American company has been able to achieve as much success as Tesla in terms of electric vehicle production and s. Numbers don't lie and Tesla outsold popular gas models from Honda, Stellantis and Toyota in 2024. In fact, it's the only electric vehicle to break into the top 25 best-selling vehicles of the year list in 2024. It dominated s in states like California, Neva, New Jersey and Washington.Why are people attacking Tesla?As an electric vehicle enthusiast, there are plenty of reasons to love the brand's products. Hence why it was the best-selling vehicle in the world at a point in 2024 (as per Statista). On the other hand, there's a nationwide attack on the once-beloved electric vehicle company, and it has everything to do with reactions to Musk's involvement with the government.Americans are vandalizing Teslas at erships as well as in parking lots. Several videos of people keying Teslas have gone viral on social media platforms Instagram and X (formerly Twitter). While some organized groups have peacefully protested against the brand, other b actors are attacking Tesla owners on and off the ro.Such attacks have officially been categorized as domestic terrorism according to Attorney General Pam Bondi. Furthermore, the FBI has created a task force to investigate and prevent anti-Tesla attacks, according to CNN. Musk has hinted that his involvement with DOGE would be temporary, but would his exit from the public sector be enough of a reprieve for the company's falling stock?The future of Tesla in AmericaTesla is an American company that produces competitive electric vehicles. Its stock has me plenty of investors big bucks over the last five years, boasting a massive 550% gain based on charts. Its network of electric vehicle chargers benefits thousands of drivers daily, especially since they can be used to charge non-Tesla EVs.Tesla products have a place in the market, but there's a tangible distrust, skepticism, and hatred for its CEO expressed by many Americans. Even shareholders have soured to the idea of Elon Musk at the helm.Tesla could continue to achieve great things in America and internationally, in terms of products, s, and innovation. That said, its board has some serious thinking to do because consumer sentiment makes or breaks brands.

MuskNews • Wall Street loses ground, breaking a 9-day winning streak, and crude oil prices tumble • May 5, 2025, 5:16 PM ET(AP)...(Show more)Tesla, Inc. is an American manufacturer of electric automobiles, solar panels, and batteries for cars and power storage. It was founded in 2003 by American entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning and was named after Serbian American inventor Nikola Tesla. It quickly became one of the most recognizable car brands in the world.Origins and the RosterTesla Motors was formed to develop an electric sports car. Eberhard was Tesla’s chief executive officer (CEO) and Tarpenning its chief financial officer (CFO). Funding for the company was obtained from a variety of sources, most notably PayPal cofounder Elon Musk, who contributed more than $30 million to the new venture and served as chair of the company beginning in 2004.In 2008 Tesla Motors released its first car, the completely electric Roster. In company tests, it achieved 245 miles (394 km) on a single charge, a range unprecedented for a production electric car. ditional tests showed that its performance was comparable to that of many gasoline-powered sports cars:Acceleration from 0 to 60 miles (96 km) per hour in less than four secondsTop speed of 125 miles (200 km) per hourEfficiency ratings equivalent to a gasoline mileage of 135 miles per gallon (57 km per liter)The Roster’s body was me of carbon fiber, the lightweight—but stronger than steel—material used in many of the world’s top supercars. Plus, the automobile produced no tailpipe emissions, as it did not use an internal-combustion engine. Its electric motor was powered by lithium-ion cells—often used in laptop computer batteries—that could be recharged from a standard electrical outlet. Despite a federal tax credit of $7,500 for purchasing an electric vehicle, the Roster’s cost of $109,000 me it a luxury item.In late 2007 Eberhard resigned as CEO and president of technology and joined the visory board of the company. It was announced in 2008 that he h left the company, although he remained a shareholder. Tarpenning, who was vice president of electrical engineering, supervising the development of electronic and software systems for the Roster, also left the company in 2008. Musk took over as CEO. In 2010 Tesla’s initial public ing raised some $226 million. UsTerms & Conditions Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.",

Some of the shine has come off Tesla's reputation in the minds of US consumers, according to a new survey ranking of the US's most reputable brands.

Tesla received \"excellent\" scores in the trajectory, vision, and products and services — and a \"very good\" score in growth.

Subaru 24. BMW 32. Ford 34. General Motors 56. Volkswagen 62. Tesla 67. Chrysler (Stellantis) Source: Axios Harris Poll The Axios Harris Poll 100 surveyed 16,310 \"nationally representative\" Americans from March 13 to 28. The process starts by \"surveying the public's top-of-mind awareness of companies that either excel or falter in society.\" Survey respondents are asked which two companies, in their opinion, currently stand out with the best reputation and which two have the worst reputation. The answers are compiled to determine which companies have the most visibility. The top 100 companies were rated on nine dimensions, including character, trajectory, and trust. Most of the attention on Tesla's CEO Musk has been focused on his leership of Twitter, which he bought for $44 billion last October — and it has concerned some of Tesla's investors who think Musk is too distracted and overcommitted to his other companies. In an open letter sent in April to Tesla's chairwoman Robyn Denholm and director Ira Ehrenpreis, 17 of Tesla's shareholders said, \"The Board allowed the CEO to be overcommitted at a time when the company faces critical challenges. Corporate boards can and should intervene if a chief executive appears to be distracted or overly focused on other ventures.\" Tesla has faced multiple issues recently, including a lawsuit from a California regulator over allegations that its Fremont Factory is a \"racially segregated workplace where Black workers are subjected to racial slurs and discriminated against.\" The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing told The Wall Street Journal it received \"hundreds of complaints from workers.\" Neither Tesla nor Musk responded to Insider's request for comment. The EV company has also faced criticism from customers who were upset the company slashing prices for some of its models, saying they felt \"cheated,\" and \"taken vantage of.\" Earlier this year, Tesla h to recall over 362,000 of its cars due to an issue with its Full Self-Driving software that the National Highway Traffic Safety ministration said \"increases the risk of a crash\" and could cause the car to \"act unsafe around intersections.\" The top ranked automotive company on the Axios Harris Poll 100 was Toyota, ranking sixth among all 100 most visible brands. Honda, Subaru, BMW, Ford, General Motors, and Volkswagen all ranked above Tesla, and Chrysler ranked last among all automotive companies, coming in at No. 67.

The Electric Vehicle Intelligence Report (EVIR) surveyed 8,000 US consumers to ask them questions electric vehicle purchasing decisions, both asking brands and finding out what they value in an EV purchase. The most notable result of the survey is that consumers h the most negative view of Tesla – and in fact, Tesla is the only brand in the survey which received a net negative brand image. When asked whether they have a positive or negative view of Tesla, 32% said they have a “very” or “somewhat” positive view combined, but 39% said they have a “very” or “somewhat” negative view. - scroll for more content This means Tesla has a -7% net score, behind even VinFast, which has a 0% net score (mostly because most surveyed hn’t heard of the Vietnamese brand). As for other brands, ironically, the top-ranked EV brand was Honda, a company that only sells one full BEV in the US, the Prologue (which people like and is selling great), which it didn’t even make itself, but rather me it in partnership with GM. Chevrolet scored well also, third place overall in brand perception. The other EV startups (Lucid, Rivian, Polestar) did tend towards the bottom of the table, but this was largely because they h comparatively lower brand awareness, and thus their net positive numbers could not have been much higher (Lucid, for example, h 9% positive and 4% negative scores). Tesla, however, h both extremely high brand awareness and negative brand association. (But you have heard of me…) Tesla’s score gets even worse when “view intensity” is taken into , with people 13 points more likely to have a “very negative” view than a “very positive” one. This negative brand perception persisted through all income brackets, regions and ages, with Tesla holding last place in each category. In every category save one, when asked whether they would consider purchasing a Tesla, the most common answer was “would never consider.” Tesla also ranked last in a comparison of various EV charger brands and battery brands, with more consumers saying they “would never consider” it. Similar numbers appeared in a question “brand trust,” where Tesla again h negative net trust, and a much higher “distrust a lot” score than its “trust a lot” score. Tesla performed slightly better in perceptions of safety (second last) and family-friendliness (fourth from last), but did well in perceptions of luxury, holding fifth place overall out of eighteen brands. According to this survey, the drop in Tesla brand perception has been quite recent. EVIR asked how views of Tesla h changed over the last 6 months. 46% said their opinion hn’t changed, but a total of 38% of people h a “more” or “much more” negative perception, versus 16% who h a “more” or “much more” positive perception. This, again, becomes more of a severe difference when you look at the most intense answers: 27% h a “much more negative” perception, while only 6% h a “much more positive” perception – a 4.5x difference. Overall, over the last 6 months, there was only a +1% net change in consumers positive perceptions of EVs as a whole, so this drastic recent change was limited to Tesla, not other brands. There was one piece of good news for Tesla, though: when asked which sort of public charging equipment consumers would most prefer, Tesla came out on top… except it also came out on top of the list that consumers would least prefer. EVIR also asked what the factors driving consumers’ interest or disinterest in purchasing an EV. Consumers recognized the benefits of EVs, with the top factors driving EV interest being gas savings, environment/climate change, and the ability to charge at . Consumers who were alrey considering buying an EV found these to be more important factors than consumers who said they aren’t thinking an EV yet. Unfortunately, consumers also fell victim to the myths they’ve long been told EVs. We’ve seen for a long time that consumers claim that range is one of their main concerns with EVs, despite that there are plenty of EVs available with way more range than you actually need. In the EVIR, consumers ranked “length of range on a battery charge” as their top concern, even though EVs on average have enough range for a full week worth of driving from the average driver. The second and fourth concerns, “availability of charging stations” and “I couldn’t charge at my residence” are much more pertinent. While it’s common for non-EV drivers not to recognize how many chargers are available, this is an area where the EV industry could definitely improve (I’ve long been on record saying that charger availability, especially for apartment dwellers and street parkers, is the only real problem with EVs – and that solving these problems will help people recognize that giant range numbers are not as necessary as they think). Happily, the NACS transition will help to solve a lot of these problems, along with the existence of new well-funded charging networks like IONNA.

Electrek’s Take As we’ve been warning people for quite some time now, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is doing his best to completely destroy Tesla’s brand. As an EV publication, we have the same mission as Tesla – to vance sustainable transport. In order for that to happen, we obviously want the (formerly) largest EV company in the world to do its job the best it can. The problem is, Musk doesn’t have that mission, and has been doing his best over the last year(s) to ruin Tesla’s brand perception with increasingly idiotic decisions, both in terms of his public vocacy and his work within Tesla. Musk’s high- political vocacy, which has included support for German neo-Nazis and agreeing with a defense of Hitler’s actions in the Holocaust, among many other white supremacist statements, has driven protests against the company, embarrassed owners and pushed many customers away. Top comment by Chris PNW Liked by 19 people One should place greater blame for the current condition of Tesla squarely with the Board of Directors as they are treating Tesla as if it is 100% owned by Elon Musk. You can sense their operating behavior is to put the wants of Mr. Musk 1st and shareholders 2nd. Does this not expose the Chairman of the Board to civil liability for failing to carry-out her job as stated in her contract? If the CEO of VW, GM, Ford, or Daimler acted in the same way as Mr. Musk, I have no doubt they would be forced to resign and succession plans invoked immediately. Herbert Diess former CEO of Volkswagen was forced to step down from his four-year tenure following a series of missteps over strategy (Software) and communication style. Given Mr. Musk has cost the company billions in damaged reputation, lost opportunities with the failed Cybertruck project, and production Tesla FSD is almost a dece late, one could suggest Musk has been treated very 'special'. View all This report shows the effect of the constant drumbeat of b Tesla business moves and horrendous public behavior by the company’s CEO. The company’s employees, for the most part, are still working to try to make good electric vehicles, but Musk is spending the money he me from selling EVs to try to ruin EVs – something that the company itself h to call him out on in its quarterly report (and which the formerly-more-lucid Musk would have opposed just a few years ago before he forgot how climate change works). Unfortunately, Tesla’s board seems content to destroy the company, and its shareholders do too, as they voted again last year to give Musk $55 billion in exchange for his b leership, an award that is greater than the total amount of profits Tesla has me over its entire lifetime. That pay package was stopped by a court for violating corporate law. We’re not sure what’s going to many any of them wake up to Musk’s destruction of the company, but this report is just one more data point showing how severe the situation has gotten.
