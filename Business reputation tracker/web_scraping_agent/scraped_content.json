      "content": "If you’re thinking about starting with Why Unified and trying to decide between Amazon and Walmart, here’s what I’ve learned from running both.I started with Amazon first, and while the orders came in quickly, I also dealt with a lot of returns. Some of them didn’t even make sense, like people returning items half-used or even sending back the wrong product. It felt like there was a lot of fraud happening, and that really cuts into profits. So if you’re going the Amazon route, just be prepared for that side of it.Walmart, on the other hand, has been a lot better for me personally. The orders are usually in bigger quantities, like customers buying in bulk, and the return rate is way lower. I also haven’t dealt with the same kind of sketchy returns that I saw on Amazon. I think the customer base is just different.So if you’re just starting out and can only choose one, I’d say Walmart might be the better option based on my experience. See more",

      "content": "Hi team,\n\nI need help with a buyer feedback issue that I feel was handled unfairly.\n\nHere’s the feedback the buyer left: “Looks like I’ve Recieved the fake version of Jumiso. Look at the logo on the bottles! Doesn’t deserve 1 star”\n\nThis was an FBA order, and the comment is clearly a product review, not about fulfillment or customer service. I tried using the automated feedback removal tool, but it was denied. I responded to the feedback removal request case 11079938842, and Seller Support also denied it, saying the buyer claimed the product was counterfeit and that I’m not the brand owner.\n\nThe problem is, this feedback caused a policy violation on our account, which was stressful. But after Amazon reviewed our inventory, the violation was removed, and we were allowed to sell the product again. So even Amazon confirmed the item isn’t counterfeit.\n\nWe’ve always followed the rules and only sell genuine products. This buyer didn’t even contact us and just assumed something was wrong. Now we’re stuck with a damaging 1-star review that’s misleading and goes against Amazon’s feedback policy -  it’s a product review on an FBA order, and it should qualify for removal.\n\nWe also couldn’t reach out to the buyer because there was no option to message them.\n\nI’d appreciate it if someone could take another look at this. The feedback is hurting our account over something that’s already been resolved by Amazon.\n\nThanks in advance for any help!  @Ezra_Amazon @Julia_Amazon @Sakura_Amazon_ @Sarah_Amzn @JiAlex_Amazon\n\n@Simon_Amazon @Spencer_Amazon @Winston_Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi team,\n\nI need help with a buyer feedback issue that I feel was handled unfairly.\n\nHere’s the feedback the buyer left: “Looks like I’ve Recieved the fake version of Jumiso.
